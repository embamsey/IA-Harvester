What's this "newspappy" thing?
==============================

newspappy offers a customized full-text search engine for one or more Internet
Archive collections. The application harvests OCRed full-text from the
collections, then creates a full-text search index. The index results then
link back to the Internet Archive reader interface.

* harvest.py: given a list of collections to harvest, collect all of the
  item identifiers for each collection, then collect the relevant metadata,
  derived full-text, and thumbnail images for each item
